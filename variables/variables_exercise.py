# Create a Variable

# In python a variable is created at the time a value is assigned to it. We dont have to declare it before initialisation.
a = 1
print("value of a is ",a)
# Varibales are case-sensitive. i.e.. variable a is different than variable A

a = 5
A = 10
print("value of a is ", a)
print("value of A is ", A)

#in the above example you can see a=5 is not ovveridden by A=10. Both are created and initialised as two different variables
